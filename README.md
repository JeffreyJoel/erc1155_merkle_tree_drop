## A Merkle-Proof-Based Claiming System for ERC1155 Tokens

## Overview
This project implements a Merkle proofs claiming mechanism to verify eligibility for ERC1155 token distribution. This approach ensures a fair and efficient distribution process, minimizing the need for individual checks and reducing gas costs.
